		<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At ReadFaster.app, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
			<li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
			<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>
			<li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>
			<li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>
		<h3>What This Policy Covers</h3>
		<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our website, mobile applications and other products and services collectively as “Services.” Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy. Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>
		<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
		<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.</p>
		<h4><em>Information You Provide to Us</em></h4>
		<p>It’s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a ReadFaster.app account to provide an email address–and that’s it. You may provide us with more information–like your name–but we don’t require that information to create a ReadFaster.app account.</li>
			<li><strong>Communications With Us (Hi There!):</strong> You may also provide us information when communicate with us about a support question, or post a question about your account publicly.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4><em>Information We Collect Automatically</em></h4>
		<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Log Information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services.</li>
			<li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions. We may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (when, for example, you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system’s permissions.</li>
			<li><strong>Information from Cookies &amp; Other Technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. ReadFaster.app uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>How And Why We Use Information</h3>
		<h4><em>Purposes for Using Information</em></h4>
		<p>We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To provide our Services–for example, to set up and maintain your account;</li>
			<li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</li>
			<li>To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, and protect the rights and property of ReadFaster.app and others;</li>
			<li>To communicate with you, for example through an email, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on ReadFaster.app.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4><em>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</em></h4>
		<p>A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under our Terms of Service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account--for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information--for example, to provide and update our Services, to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience, to safeguard our Services, to communicate with you, and better understand user retention and attrition, to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, and to personalize your experience; or (5) You have given us your consent--for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on.</p>
		<h3>Sharing Information</h3>
		<h4><em>How We Share Information</em></h4>
		<p>We do not sell our users’ private personal information. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</li>
			<li><strong>Third Party Vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, and data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by ReadFaster.app), those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), and companies that make products available on our websites, who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.</li>
			<li><strong>Legal Requests:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
			<li><strong>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ReadFaster.app, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that ReadFaster.app goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
			<li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the social media services that you connect to your account.</li>
			<li><strong>Aggregated or De-Identified Information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services and we may share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>How Long We Keep Information</h3>
		<p>We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it--which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information--and we are not legally required to continue to keep it. For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of ReadFaster.app’s websites, such as the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to ReadFaster.app’s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.</p>
		<h3>Security</h3>
		<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>
		<h3>Choices</h3>
		<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Opt-Out of Electronic Communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us. Just follow the instructions in those messages. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices.</li>
			<li><strong>Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:</strong> At this time, ReadFaster.app does not respond to “do not track” signals across all of our Services. However, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using ReadFaster.app’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of ReadFaster.app’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>
			<li><strong>Close Your Account:</strong> While we’d be very sad to see you go, if you no longer want to use our Services :( :( :( :(, you can delete your ReadFaster.app account. Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above--for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Your Rights</h3>
		<p>If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the “GDPR”), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
			<li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
			<li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
			<li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
			<li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren’t able to do that, or you would like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, find out how to reach us. EU individuals also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>
		<h3>How to Reach Us</h3>
		<p>If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please <a href="mailto:contact@readfaster.app">contact us</a>.</p>
		<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
		<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, ReadFaster.app may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. ReadFaster.app encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. That’s it! Thanks for reading.</p>
